                  <p>"The children at Kid Kollege love the taste of Penny Juice and drink it without encouragement from out teachers. I like Penny Juice for this reason and because it is 100% juice from concentrate requiring no refrigeration prior to mixing. The handy mix pitcher takes the guess work out of preparation."<p>

                  <p>"As the director of a university affiliated, but privatly owned child care facility top quality products that are also budget-friendly are essential. I especially like the ease of ordering on-line or by phone, knowing that the juice will be promptly delivered directly to the center. No more hauling shopping carts full of frozen juice concentrate from the grocery store!"</p>

                  <p>"The children, teachers, and parents all love Penny Juice. There is no more lugging fifty bottles of juice around the grocery store, to the car, and back to the preschool. We have also found it to be less expensive than even sale prices at the grocery store."</p>
